                        <h2>Understanding Macau’s Customs: A Guide to Local Etiquette
                        </h2>
                        <p>Macau's customs and traditions offer valuable insights into the local way of life.
                            Understanding these practices can enhance your experience and ensure respectful
                            interactions with residents.
                        </p>
                        <p>When visiting Macau, it’s important to be mindful of local etiquette. For example, it is
                            customary to greet with a friendly nod or smile rather than a handshake, especially in more
                            traditional settings. In temples and religious sites, dress modestly and remove your hat
                            before entering.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dining customs also play a significant role in Macau’s culture. It’s polite to wait for the
                            host to
                            start the meal and to use chopsticks correctly. When visiting a casino or attending a formal
                            event, dress appropriately and adhere to the established dress codes.</p>
                        <p>Respecting Macau’s customs and etiquette helps foster positive interactions and enriches
                            your visit. By understanding and embracing local practices, you can fully appreciate the
                            city’s
                            culture and traditions.
